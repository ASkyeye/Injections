# Injections
A repository where I share my injection implementations 

# TODO
1. API Hooking LIB is not injected but modifies its own process, add injection - perhaps I can use Reflective-PE?
2. I'm using globals within the API hook lib, ugh, ew.
3. Add 64 bit support for the API hooking, although it works when compiled at x64..
